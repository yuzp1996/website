# Events

Tekton runtime resources, specifically `TaskRuns` and `PipelineRuns`,
emit events when they are executed, so that users can monitor their lifecycle
and react to it.

Tekton emits [kubernetes events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#event-v1-core), that can be retrieve from the resource via `kubectl describe [resource]`.
[Optionally](#cloudevents) Tekton can emit [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) too.

No events are emitted for `Conditions` today (https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2461).

## TaskRuns

`TaskRun` events are generated for the following `Reasons`:

- `Started`: this is triggered the first time the `TaskRun` is picked by the
  reconciler from its work queue, so it only happens if web-hook validation was
  successful. Note that this event does not imply that a step started executing,
  as several conditions must be met first:
  - task and bound resource validation must be successful
  - attached conditions must run successfully
  - the `Pod` associated to the `TaskRun` must be successfully scheduled
- `Succeeded`: this is triggered once all steps in the `TaskRun` are executed
  successfully, including post-steps injected by Tekton.
- `Failed`: this is triggered if the `TaskRun` is completed, but not successfully.
  Causes of failure may be: one the steps failed, the `TaskRun` was cancelled or
  the `TaskRun` timed out. `Failed` events are also triggered in case the `TaskRun`
  cannot be executed at all because of validation issues.

## PipelineRuns

`PipelineRun` events are generated for the following `Reasons`:

- `Started`: this is triggered the first time the `PipelineRun` is picked by the
  reconciler from its work queue, so it only happens if web-hook validation was
  successful. Note that this event does not imply that a step started executing,
  as pipeline, task and bound resource validation must be successful first.
- `Running`: this is triggered when the `PipelineRun` passes validation and
  actually starts running.
- `Succeeded`: this is triggered once all `Tasks` reachable via the DAG are
  executed successfully.
- `Failed`: emitted if the `PipelineRun` finishes running unsuccessfully because a `Task` failed or the
  `PipelineRun` timed out or was cancelled. A `PipelineRun` also emits `Failed` events if it cannot
  execute at all due to failing validation.

# Events via `CloudEvents`

When you [configure a sink](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/release-v0.14.x/docs/install.md#configuring-cloudevents-notifications), Tekton emits
events as described in the table below.

Resource      |Event    |Event Type
:-------------|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------
`TaskRun`     | `Started` | `dev.tekton.event.taskrun.started.v1`
`TaskRun`     | `Running` | `dev.tekton.event.taskrun.runnning.v1`
`TaskRun`     | `Condition Change while Running` | `dev.tekton.event.taskrun.unknown.v1`
`TaskRun`     | `Succeed` | `dev.tekton.event.taskrun.successful.v1`
`TaskRun`     | `Failed`  | `dev.tekton.event.taskrun.failed.v1`
`PipelineRun` | `Started` | `dev.tekton.event.pipelinerun.started.v1`
`PipelineRun` | `Running` | `dev.tekton.event.pipelinerun.runnning.v1`
`PipelineRun` | `Condition Change while Running` | `dev.tekton.event.pipelinerun.unknown.v1`
`PipelineRun` | `Succeed` | `dev.tekton.event.pipelinerun.successful.v1`
`PipelineRun` | `Failed`  | `dev.tekton.event.pipelinerun.failed.v1`
