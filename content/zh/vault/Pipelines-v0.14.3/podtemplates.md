# Pod templates

A pod template specifies a subset of
[`PodSpec`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#pod-v1-core)
configuration that will be used as the basis for the `Task` pod.

This allows for customizing some `Pod` specific field per `Task` execution, `TaskRun` or for all `Task` executions part of a `PipelineRun`.

Alternatively, you can also define a default pod template in Tekton config, see [Customizing basic execution parameters](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/release-v0.14.x/docs/install.md#customizing-basic-execution-parameters)
When a pod template is specified for a `PipelineRun` or `TaskRun`, the default pod template is ignored, i.e.
both templates are **NOT** merged, it's always one or the other.

---

The current fields supported are:

- `nodeSelector`: a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on
  a node, see [Assigning pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/).
- `tolerations`: allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto
  nodes with matching taints.
- `affinity`: allow to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to
  be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.
- `securityContext`: pod-level security attributes and common
  container settings, like `runAsUser` or `selinux`.
- `volumes`: list of volumes that can be mounted by containers
  belonging to the pod. This lets the user of a Task define which type
  of volume to use for a Task `volumeMount`
- `runtimeClassName`: the name of a
  [runtime class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/)
  to use to run the pod.
- `automountServiceAccountToken`: whether the token for the service account
  being used by the pod should be automatically provided inside containers at a
  predefined path. Defaults to `true`.
- `dnsPolicy`: the
  [DNS policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy)
  for the pod, one of `ClusterFirst`, `Default`, or `None`. Defaults to
  `ClusterFirst`. Note that `ClusterFirstWithHostNet` is not supported by Tekton
  as Tekton pods cannot run with host networking.
- `dnsConfig`:
  [additional DNS configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-config)
  for the pod, such as nameservers and search domains.
- `enableServiceLinks`: whether services in the same namespace as the pod will
  be exposed as environment variables to the pod, similar to Docker service
  links. Defaults to `true`.
- `priorityClassName`: the name of the
  [priority class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/)
  to use when running the pod. Use this, for example, to selectively enable
  preemption on lower priority workloads.
- `schedulerName` the name of the 
  [scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/)
  to use when dispatching the Pod. This can be used when workloads of specific types need specific schedulers,
  e.g.: If you are using volcano.sh for Machine Learning Workloads, you can pass the schedulerName and have Tasks be 
  dispatched by the volcano.sh scheduler.
- `imagePullSecret` the name of the [`secret`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) used when [pulling the image if specified](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). 
- `hostNetwork`: set this to `true` if the host network namespace should be used.
  Defaults to `false`.


A `Pod` template can be specified for `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun` resources.
See [Specifying a Pod template](/vault/Pipelines-v0.14.3/taskruns/#specifying-a-pod-template) for a `TaskRun` example or
[Specifying a Pod template](/vault/Pipelines-v0.14.3/pipelineruns/#specifying-a-pod-template) for a `PipelineRun` example using Pod templates.
