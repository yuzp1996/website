# Overview

A `Run` allows you to instantiate and execute a [Custom
Task](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/teps/0002-custom-tasks.md),
which can be implemented by a custom task controller running on-cluster. Custom
Tasks can implement behavior that doesn't correspond directly to running a
workload in a `Pod` on the cluster. For Pod-based on-cluster workloads, you
should use a [`TaskRun`](/vault/Pipelines-v0.18.1/taskruns/).

In order for a `Run` to actually execute, there must be a custom task
controller running on the cluster that is responsible for watching and updating
`Run`s which reference their type. If no such controller is running, `Run`s
will have no `.status` value and no further action will be taken.

`Run`s are an **_experimental alpha feature_** and should be expected to change
in breaking ways or even be removed.

`Run`s are not currently integrated with Pipelines, and require a running
third-party controller to actually perform any work. Without a third-party
controller, `Run`s will just exist without a status indefinitely.

## Configuring a `Run`

A `Run` definition supports the following fields:

- Required:
  - [`apiVersion`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the API version, for example
    `tekton.dev/v1beta1`.
  - [`kind`][kubernetes-overview] - Identifies this resource object as a `Run` object.
  - [`metadata`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the metadata that uniquely identifies the
    `Run`, such as a `name`.
  - [`spec`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the configuration for the `Run`.
    - [`ref`](#specifying-the-target-custom-task) - Specifies the type and
      (optionally) name of the custom task type to execute.
- Optional:
  - [`params`](#specifying-parameters) - Specifies the desired execution
    parameters for the custom task.

### Specifying the target Custom Task

To specify the custom task type you want to execute in your `Run`, use the
`ref` field as shown below:

```yaml
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Example
```

This initiates the execution of a `Run` of a custom task of type `Example`, in
the `example.dev` API group,  with the version `v1alpha1`.

You can also specify the `name` and optional `namespace` (default is `default`)
of a custom task resource object previously defined in the cluster.

```yaml
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Example
    name: my-example
```

If the `ref` specifies a name, the custom task controller should look up the
`Example` resource with that name, and use that object to configure the
execution.

If the `ref` does not specify a name, the custom task controller might support
some default behavior for executing unnamed tasks.

In either case, if the named resource cannot be found, or if unnamed tasks are
not supported, the custom task controller should update the `Run`'s status to
indicate the error.

### Specifying `Parameters`

If a custom task supports [`parameters`](/vault/Pipelines-v0.18.1/tasks/#parameters), you can use the
`params` field in the `Run` to specify their values:

```yaml
spec:
  params:
  - name: my-param
    value: chicken
```

If the custom task controller knows how to interpret the parameter value, it
will do so. It might enforce that some parameter values must be specified, or
reject unknown parameter values.

## Monitoring execution status

As your `Run` executes, its `status` field accumulates information on the
execution of the `Run`. This information includes start and completion times,
and any output `results` reported by the custom task controller.

The following example shows the `status` field of a `Run` that has executed
successfully:

```yaml
completionTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:57Z"
conditions:
- lastTransitionTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:57Z"
  message: Execution was successful
  reason: Succeeded
  status: "True"
  type: Succeeded
startTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:51Z"
```

The following tables shows how to read the overall status of a `Run`:

`status`|Description
:-------|-----------:
<unset>|The custom task controller has not taken any action on the Run.
Unknown|The custom task controller has started execution and the Run is ongoing.
True|The Run completed successfully.
False|The Run completed unsuccessfully.

In any case, the custom task controller should populate the `reason` and
`message` fields to provide more information about the status of the execution.

### Monitoring `Results`

After the `Run` completes, the custom task controller can report output
values
in the `results` field:

```
results:
- name: my-result
  value: chicken
```

## Code examples

To better understand `Runs`, study the following code examples:

- [Example `Run` with a referenced custom task](#example-run-with-a-referenced-custom-task)
- [Example `Run` with an unnamed custom task](#example-run-with-an-unnamed-custom-task)
- [Example of specifying parameters](#example-of-specifying-parameters)

### Example `Run` with a referenced custom task

In this example, a `Run` named `my-example-run` invokes a custom task of the `v1alpha1`
version of the `Example` kind in the `example.dev` API group, with the name
`my-example-task`.

In this case the custom task controller is expected to look up the `Example`
resource named `my-example-task` and to use that configuration to configure the
execution of the `Run`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Run
metadata:
  name: my-example-run
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Example
    name: my-example-task
```

### Example `Run` with an unnamed custom task

In this example, a `Run` named `my-example-run` invokes a custom task of the `v1alpha1`
version of the `Example` kind in the `example.dev` API group, without a specified name.

In this case the custom task controller is expected to provide some default
behavior when the referenced task is unnamed.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Run
metadata:
  name: my-example-run
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Example
```

### Example of specifying parameters

In this example, a `Run` named `my-example-run` invokes a custom task, and
specifies some parameter values to further configure the execution's behavior.

In this case the custom task controller is expected to validate and interpret
these parameter values and use them to configure the `Run`'s execution.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Run
metadata:
  name: my-example-run
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Example
    name: my-example-task
  params:
  - name: my-first-param
    value: i'm number one
  - name: my-second-param
    value: close second
```
